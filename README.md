## üìù Description

Welcome to MovieLand! A responsive React application that allows users to search for movies using the TMDB API while implementing a real-time trending feature that tracks user search patterns to display the most popular searches dynamically.

Many movie discovery platforms lack personalized trending features based on actual user behavior. Traditional movie apps typically display trending content based on pre-determined metrics rather than real user activity within the application itself.

This project aimed to solve this problem by creating a responsive movie search application that not only fetches data from an external API but also tracks and analyzes user search patterns to generate a dynamic trending section.

**Technologies Used:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Appwrite, TMDB API

## ‚ú® Features

- **Trending Algorithm:** Implemented a custom algorithm that tracks user searches, stores them in an Appwrite database, and displays the top five most searched movies in real-time, creating a Netflix-like trending section based on actual user behavior.
- **Optimized Search with Debouncing:** Implemented input debouncing using the useDebounce hook from react-use to prevent excessive API calls, improving performance by waiting for users to stop typing before making requests.
- **Responsive Component Architecture:** Created a modular component structure with presentational components like MovieCard that accept props for rendering, making the application maintainable and scalable while ensuring consistent UI across all device sizes.
